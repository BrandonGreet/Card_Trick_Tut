This is a quick tutorial project taken from FreeCodeCamp.
Basically you ask a volunteer to pick a card from a deck, and then tell everybody what that card is. You should have someone else available and listening to add the volunteer and their card to the database. Then have the volunteer request their name from the databse to see their card. *MAGIC*
